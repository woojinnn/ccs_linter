This is a simple extension that adds basic syntax highlighting for CCS and to provide a basis for adding
fancier features if anybody is ever interested in it.

Add a link to the CCS VSCode extension directory to your VSCode extensions directory.
```
cd $HOME/.vscode/extensions
ln -s <ccs_linter_directory> ccs.ccs-0.0.1
